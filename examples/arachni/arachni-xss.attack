Feature: Look for cross site scripting (xss) using arachni against a URL

Scenario: Using the arachni, look for cross site scripting and verify no issues are found
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following profile:
     | name                | value                          |
     | url                 | http://107.23.92.236/webapps/         |
  When I launch an "arachni-simple_xss" attack
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."
